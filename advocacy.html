          BlueLabs helps lighten the load by finding supporters more efficiently, identifying the right activism asks for each person, and maximizing donations. It also provides an online analytics and reporting tool, BlueHQ, to help groups obtain a real-time picture of their activities and performance metrics.<br><br>
          With these tools, our clients have been able to raise more money, increase the effectiveness of their activism outreach, raise awareness for their issues, and advance their policy objectives.

              <p class="buffer-bottom-tiny">BlueLabs devised an analytics strategy focused on voters who were likely to be persuaded by both positive and negative messaging. By targeting these highly persuadable voters, the goal was to ‘harden’ supporters against negative messaging, and to persuade and recruit new supporters. The program was launched in May, and included a large survey fielded in June. By mid-July, BlueLabs had deployed the support and persuasion universes. By the first half of August, the client had a detailed cross-channel and TV optimized plan, including the most cost-effective TV shows and channels to reach target audiences.</p>

              <h5>Results</h5>
              <p class="buffer-bottom-tiny">In subsequent campaign polls, BlueLabs’ models validated very well. Voters identified by the models as strong targets were 2.13x more likely to resist negative messages than weak targets. By our estimates, relying on person-level uplift scores enabled the campaign to reach more than 3 times as many strong targets with the same budget.</p>

              <div class="col-md-6 panel-body">
                <p class="buffer-bottom-tiny">A common challenge for many of BlueLabs’ clients is activating their supporters and moving them up the ladder of engagement. Whether asking supporters to sign an online petition or to volunteer, getting them to cross the threshold from observers to participants can be difficult. With years of experience optimizing activism outreach for campaigns and advocacy groups, BlueLabs was engaged to help a national advocacy organization promote a high-profile policy issue by improving the effectiveness and efficiency of patch-through calls to elected officials.</p>
                <h5>BlueLabs’ Solution</h5>
                <p class="buffer-bottom-tiny">BlueLabs conducted a national phone survey exploring support for the policy issue and willingness to volunteer. Based on survey results, we built a model that generated scores for each adult representing their likelihood of volunteering, including agreeing to be patched through to their elected officials. BlueLabs matched the scores to the client’s phone vendor data to facilitate implementation of the program.</p>

                <h5>Results</h5>
                <p class="buffer-bottom-tiny">Patch-through success went from a pre-model baseline rate of 5% to a post model rate of 30% among the strongest targets - a six-fold efficiency gain.</p>

              In this specific instance, an advocacy organization invited BlueLabs to participate in a head-to-head with an experienced fundraising firm. The organization was looking to increase donations from its current donor base through a mail campaign.</p>
              <h5>BlueLabs’ Solution</h5>
              <p class="buffer-bottom-tiny">Our team compiled data from the organization’s fundraising platforms and matched it to a consumer data file. Our data scientists then built a score to identify active members who were most likely give a donation if solicited. 
              <br>
              After we built and validated the scores, our client carried out a large mail appeal split into three groups of prospective donors: a random sample, a target universe based on BlueLabs’ top targets, and a universe based on the other firm’s targets.</p>

              <h5>Results</h5>
              <p class="buffer-bottom-tiny">In this head-to-head test, BlueLabs’ targeting not only beat the random sample by a very large margin but also won against the fundraising vendor across all metrics - 38% more income, 32% more gifts, and 6% higher average donation amounts.</p>
