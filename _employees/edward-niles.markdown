​Ed is Lead Media Strategist for Bluelabs. He is focused on using BlueLabs’ expertise in predictive modeling and data-driven targeting to optimize media spending and messaging for partner groups. Ed began his career as a data analyst for a major telecom carrier, but eventually found his true calling in politics. He was the Data and Analytics Director for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee’s 2014 Independent Expenditure, where he developed and tested new methods to maximize the IE’s paid media resources. His political career spans from Senator John Edward’s Presidential Campaign, to the Voter Activation Network (VAN), the Atlas Project, and managing Manan Trivedi’s first bid for Congress in Pennsylvania. Having graduated from the University of Wisconsin-Madison Ed cheers for all things Badgers and he truly enjoys a tumbler of good Irish Whiskey every once in a while.
