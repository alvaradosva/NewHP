Vince is a seasoned software architect with a passion for clean code, craft beer and the command line.

After graduating from Carnegie Mellon University with a degree in Computer Science, Vince worked at research labs and start-ups, on some then-cutting-edge robotic and mobile technology (now relegated to museums).

More recently, he was schooled in the dark bureaucratic arts while building large biometric systems for the Federal government.  Vince is very happy to get back to his roots and work with a group of passionate technologists to do great things!


Vince's ideal Jeopardy category would be 'operating systems from the 1970s'.
