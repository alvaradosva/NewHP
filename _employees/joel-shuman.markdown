Joel is an analyst turned Data Scientist with a passion for progressive politics.  After studying physics and French at Pomona College, he worked at different tech startups around the Bay Area. He came to Blue Labs to work on projects that help all those candidates and causes he was always bothering his friends and family about.  You can find him either hiking on open trails or at your local open mic serenading the crowd.
