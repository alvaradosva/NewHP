After attaining a bachelorâ€™s degree from Brown University in Economics and International Relations, Harrison joined the DNC as an Elections Analyst, perhaps unaware that many of his new colleagues would shadow him as he went first to the Obama campaign as a Battleground States Analyst responsible for the Western region and later to BlueLabs. Time spent growing up in Canada fostered his passion for playing and watching hockey, and a steady flow of moose and maple syrup jokes from his peers.
