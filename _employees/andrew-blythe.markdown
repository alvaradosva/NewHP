Andrew is a Data Scientist at BlueLabs. He studied international politics at Georgetown’s School of Foreign Service before getting a masters in math and statistics. A Colorado native, he comes to BlueLabs after stints crunching medical data at DecisionQ and covering elections, hurricanes and the occasional celebrity funeral for a European news agency. In his off hours, he’s part of a pretty decent bar trivia team and hosts backyard movie nights.
