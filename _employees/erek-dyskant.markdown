Erek is passionate about crowdsourcing data analysis and collection, enabling organizations to become more data-driven from the bottom up. Before co-founding BlueLabs, he was the Tech Lead for Geospatial Analytics at Obama for America, where his team conceived and built a mapping system used by field organizers to choose locations where volunteers were needed most. Between election cycles he worked in the field for a global health NGO, where he helped build systems to collect data from the NGOâ€™s medical clinics. Ask him about the character and history of neighborhoods in DC.
