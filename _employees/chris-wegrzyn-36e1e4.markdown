Chris Wegrzyn is a leading practitioner in the application of analytics and big data technology to political campaigns. As a cofounder of BlueLabs, he hopes to bring this new technology to other important causes and challenging problems. From his earliest days with the Obama campaign in 2007, he began formulating a vision for the role of emerging data and analytics technologies in the campaign. As the Director of Data Architecture for the Democratic National Committee (DNC) between 2011 and 2013, he realized that vision. He brought a cutting-edge new analytics technology platform to the DNC and led the Analytics Technology team on the Obama re-election campaign. In little more than a year, his team integrated data from every corner of the campaign into a central repository; built tools to analyze, manipulate, and explore the campaignâ€™s massive database; and developed technology to support the most sophisticated analytics operation ever assembled on a campaign.
