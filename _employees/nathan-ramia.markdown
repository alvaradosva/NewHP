Nathan has led soldiers in combat and helped launch a real estate tech startup. He's crafted corporate communications strategy and taught himself SQL. As the Data Science Team Lead at BlueLabs, he cuts Gordian knots and generally does whatever it takes to help the data scientists push the envelope. A Memphis, TN native, he studied American Politics and Chinese at West Point before getting a Master's in Strategic Studies from the Australian National University. He's traveled to 20 countries -- lived in 3 -- and he's just getting started.
