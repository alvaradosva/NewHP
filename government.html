              <p class="buffer-bottom-tiny">In mid-2015, the District of Columbia’s Department of Health (DOH) turned to BlueLabs for help with its Medicaid sign-up tool, which was deemed too complicated and time-consuming, and resulted in data quality issues.</p>
              <h5>BlueLabs’ Solution</h5>
              <p class="buffer-bottom-tiny">Over the next six months, BlueLabs’ team of engineers and graphic designers worked closely with DOH executives and case workers to design a more intuitive Medicaid sign-up dashboard with improved user experience and data flow. Much of our work centered on reducing the number of clicks that case workers had to go through in order to sign up new Medicaid recipients, making contingent forms viewable only when necessary. Another area of improvement was on providing clearer and more immediate guidance when data entry errors were made.</p>

              <h5>Results</h5>
              <p class="buffer-bottom-tiny">The resulting dashboard was very well received and has already been successfully deployed for emergency Medicaid sign-ups.</p>

                <p class="buffer-bottom-tiny">A common challenge for many of BlueLabs’ clients is activating their supporters and moving them up the ladder of engagement. Whether asking supporters to sign an online petition or to volunteer, getting them to cross the threshold from observers to participants can be difficult. With years of experience optimizing activism outreach for campaigns and advocacy groups, BlueLabs was engaged to help a national advocacy organization promote a high-profile policy issue by improving the effectiveness and efficiency of patch-through calls to elected officials.</p>
                <h5>BlueLabs’ Solution</h5>
                <p class="buffer-bottom-tiny">BlueLabs conducted a national phone survey exploring support for the policy issue and willingness to volunteer. Based on survey results, we built a model that generated scores for each adult representing their likelihood of volunteering, including agreeing to be patched through to their elected officials. BlueLabs matched the scores to the client’s phone vendor data to facilitate implementation of the program.</p>

                <h5>Results</h5>
                <p class="buffer-bottom-tiny">Patch-through success went from a pre-model baseline rate of 5% to a post model rate of 30% among the strongest targets - a six-fold efficiency gain.</p>

              In this specific instance, an advocacy organization invited BlueLabs to participate in a head-to-head with an experienced fundraising firm. The organization was looking to increase donations from its current donor base through a mail campaign.</p>
              <h5>BlueLabs’ Solution</h5>
              <p class="buffer-bottom-tiny">Our team compiled data from the organization’s fundraising platforms and matched it to a consumer data file. Our data scientists then built a score to identify active members who were most likely give a donation if solicited. 
              <br>
              After we built and validated the scores, our client carried out a large mail appeal split into three groups of prospective donors: a random sample, a target universe based on BlueLabs’ top targets, and a universe based on the other firm’s targets.</p>

              <h5>Results</h5>
              <p class="buffer-bottom-tiny">In this head-to-head test, BlueLabs’ targeting not only beat the random sample by a very large margin but also won against the fundraising vendor across all metrics - 38% more income, 32% more gifts, and 6% higher average donation amounts.</p>
